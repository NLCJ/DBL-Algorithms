Every file's name is representative of its characteristics.
All files will be in the same folder
The name will be in the same order as this list

First: the model used (2pos, 4pos, 1slider)
Second: The distribution of the data (Even, Cluster, Real)
Third: The dimensions of the labels (10x, 50x, 200x) meaning 10by10, 50by50 and 200by200
Fourth: The number of points (10, 25, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,..., 9000, 10000)
Finally: The iteration for these specific options between 1 and 100 (#1, #2,..., #99, #100)
		As every specific options needs to be run with 100 distinct data sets
		Note: Real life data will not have 100 data sets for each specific option, so real life data will only have "#1" behind it, nothing higher

For example:
-A data set for the 2-position model, with clustered data, with 50 by 50 label dimension,
with 500 points on its 23rd map on these options (out of 100):
"2posCluster50x500#23.txt"

-A data set for the slider model, with real life data, with 200 by 200 label dimension,
with 10.000 points:
"1sliderReal200x10000#1.txt"

-A data set for the 4pos model, with even data, 
with 10 by 10 label dimensions, with 2000 points, on its 11rd map on these options:
"4posCluster10x2000#23.txt"
